# Diabetes Prediction System

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction System! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health parameters. The prediction system is implemented using Django framework along with HTML and CSS for the front-end interface.

#  Features
Prediction Model: Utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical health data to predict the probability of diabetes.
User-friendly Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive web interface for users to input their health information and receive predictions.
Accessibility: Accessible via a web browser, making it convenient for users to utilize the prediction system from anywhere.
Technologies Used
Django: Python web framework used for backend development and routing.
HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of web pages.
CSS: Utilized for styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the web interface.
Machine Learning: Employed for building and deploying the predictive model for diabetes prediction.
